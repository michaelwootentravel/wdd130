        <h2>Michael Wooten</h2>
        <h2>Wootang</h2>
        <p>My name is Michael Wooten ( I go by Michael not Mike) and I from Las Vegas, NV but currently live in Beaverton, Oregon 2 minutes walking from the Nike world headquarters. I am not married but dating and have one fur child who is a 11-year-old chihuahua mix name London (after my favor international city). I adopted him when he was two years old in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>            I always have a passion for travel and have been travelling mostly in the Czech Republic (which I consider my second home) I love the culture, food, history, and the people there. My day job is working at the bank in credit card complaints management, but my side gag is being a travel advisor. I decided to go back to school to get a certificate in hospitality and social media marketing but also focus on getting a bachelor’s degree in business management so I can own and operate my own travel agency business and educate those who want to travel and just don’t know how too.
